#### Grading

The grade is determined by your performance on projects and exams. You will receive these grades through Canvas. The projects and exams will count toward the final grade as follows:

- Projects (50% of overall grade): You will be given four projects, each requiring more work than the previous one. Each project is to be completed individually or in two-student teams, as specified in each project assignment.
    - Project 0 (5% of overall grade)
    - Project 1 (10% of overall grade)
    - Project 2 (15% of overall grade)
    - Project 3 (20% of overall grade)
- Exams (50% of overall grade)
    - Midterm (20% of overall grade)
    - Final (30% of overall grade), it **does** include questions about material covered in the Midterm

The plan is to assign final (letter) grades based on your total score, with 90% and above earning an A, 80% and above earning a B, etc. If this results in too few As, we may decide to lower the thresholds somewhat, or to use some sort of a curve - the final decision whether and what to do in this regard is up to the instructor.
